        <p> My name is Alyssa Stringham. I am 25 years old. I currently live at home with my parents and two of my three sisters. My family has two cats and two dogs. We also own three horses who are boarded at a barn near Payson, Utah. I have been teaching horse riding lessons for about three years. I spend most of my spare time at the barn, but I also enjoy reading, doing various arts and crafts, and hanging out with my friends and family.</p>
